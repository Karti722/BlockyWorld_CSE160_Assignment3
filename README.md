# CSE160_Asgn1_-WebGL- --> Kartikeya Kumaria, CruzID: kkumaria, ID#: 2026632
Here is my submission for Assignment 1 of CSE 160

# Part 12
I added a draw button so the user can see Outer Space onto the canvas. You can also clear the canvas the same way by just pressing the clear button. Click this button multiple times for the resultant canvas you prefer. You might even draw some planets on it hehehehe!

# Part 13
I made a sunset toggle button in which when you press it, it changes the page to a subsequent time. (afternoon -> sunset -> night -> sunrise -> afternoon). You can only live through the day once without sleeping. The website will remove the button so that you can sleep after you went through the full day.

# Late Submission Note
I am sorry for submitting this late. I submitted this on Thursday, January 23rd, 2025 when the assignment itself was originally due on the 19th. I will take the late penalty for the days I am late.
